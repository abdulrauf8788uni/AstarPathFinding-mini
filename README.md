# Welcome to A* visualization tool

This is a simple tool, in which you can visualize the working of A* path finding algoritm.

### How to run

* **Activate virtulenv**

Navigate to the root directory of the code in terminal and write the following code.


For windows: 

	env\scrips\activate 


For mac and linux: 

	source env\bin\activate 


* **Run main.py**

> Right click on the block to draw starting position, ending position and barriers.

> Left click to clear the block

> Escape to reset the screen (If the algorith is running you have to wait till the algorithm is finished) 

> Space to start the algorithm 


**More details**

* The blocks which are highlighted in silver represents the blocks which are explored during the search

* Yellow path represents the path found.
